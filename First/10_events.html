    <!-- An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does. -->

    <!-- Often, when events happen, you may want to do something. -->
    
    <!-- JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected. -->
    
    <p id="demo1"></p>

    <p id="demo2"></p>

    <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML = Date()">Date & Time</button><br>

    <!-- In the next example, the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML) -->

    <button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">Date & Time</button><br>

    <!-- JavaScript code is often several lines long. It is more common to see event attributes calling functions -->

    <button onclick="myFunction()">Click Me</button><br>

    <script>
    function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = Date();
    }
    </script>

    <!-- You will learn a lot more about events and event handlers in the HTML DOM chapters. -->

    <!-- In these chapters, Outputs are written with the innerHTML but further we will use console.log()
    function to print the outputs as we want to learn plain JavaScript not in browser -->
